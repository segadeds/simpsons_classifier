# simpsons_classifier
The Simpsons classifier trained with Fastai, displayed with a Jupyter notebook and Voila, deployed with Binder.

Upload a photo of a character from the simpsons. This application will tell you which character is in that image. The model has been trained with photos the simpsons characters (so it not supposed to work with paintings, animals...)
